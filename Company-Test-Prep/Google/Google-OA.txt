In the question, N (Number of Elements in an list), No. of query, list and Query is given
Query is given in the form of nested list
N - 5
Q - 2
A - [2, 1, 4, 3, 1]
query - [[1,2,2],[2,1,3]]
let's take the nested list inside query list as [a,b,c] 
if a = 1, then replace bth element (b is not the index value, it's the position) in the list as c. 
for example from the above test case:
it is given as [1,2,2]
so, we need to change the second element in the list as 2
then, A would become as [2,2,4,3,1], no need to print the updated list
if a = 2, then do the following
calculate the sum of sum of elements from b to b+1, b to b+2, ... b to c
        then b+1 to b+2, b+1 to b+3, ... b+1 to c

for example from the above test case 
[2,1,3]
I need to do the sum of the elements from 1 to 1, 1 to 2, 1 to 3, then 2 to 2 and 2 to 3 and 3 to 3
and sum all of these values and print the output
the array is [2,2,4,3,1] -> as the 2nd number was updated using previous query
1 - 3rd elements that is:
1 to 1: 2
1 to 2: 2+2 = 4
1 to 3: 2+2+4 = 8
2 to 2: 2
2 to 3: 2+4 = 6
3 to 3: 4

2+4+8+2+6+4 = 26, print this only

Please do the coding in python 
and Take input in the following format.

N -> No. of elements in list
Q -> No. of queries
A -> List
query -> Each query line by line
